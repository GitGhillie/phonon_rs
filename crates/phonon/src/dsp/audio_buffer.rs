/// Phonon processes audio in audio buffers, which contain uncompressed Pulse
/// Code Modulated (PCM) data (just like a .wav file).
///
/// Audio buffers contain one or more channels; for example, a stereo audio
/// buffer contains 2 channels. Each channel typically contains several samples,
/// which are values of the audio signalâ€™s level at discrete points of time.
/// Each channel has the same number of samples.
///
/// A sample is a 32-bit floating-point. The time interval between two
/// successive samples is specified using the sampling rate. Typical sampling
/// rates are 44100 Hz (CD quality) or 48000 Hz.
///
/// # Interleaving
/// Phonon stores audio buffers in a deinterleaved layout. This means that all
/// the samples for the first channel are store contiguously, followed by all
/// the samples for the second channel, and so on.
///
/// Most audio formats instead use an interleaved layout, where data for each
/// frame is stored together in memory. Interleaved data can be read to and
/// written from using [`AudioBuffer::read_interleaved`] and [`AudioBuffer::write_interleaved`].
