# Steam Audio Rust Rewrite

A community effort to rewrite Valve's [Steam Audio](https://github.com/ValveSoftware/steam-audio) into a Rust library.

Note: Steam Audio is massive and the benefits of rewriting it in Rust are going to be sparse at best.
Therefore, this is more of a project for people passionate about Rust + audio/maths/physics.
If you want a quicker route to using Steam Audio in your Rust project, it is better to use one of the Rust bindings out there.

Please contact me on Discord (user: ixml) to check what is being worked on and what needs to be done.

At this stage the focus is on the following:
- Try to get the tests and benchmarks working
- Write Rusty code
- Don't worry too much about performance yet (leave a 'todo' if necessary)
- Look for opportunities to make use of the Rust ecosystem
